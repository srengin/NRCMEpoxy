        <p class="lead">Don't get lured in with cheap installation cost, chances are they are doing what is called acid etching. Acid etching is a shortcut but you will get what you pay for.
          Typically epoxy flooring that has been prepared with acid etching needs to be redone after 1-5 years compared to proper preparation with concrete grinding that can last more than 20 years. </p>
          <p class="lead">So in the long run you are saving much more time and money by getting it done right the first time.</p>
